#BUG 1

- why @tanstack/react-table, @tanstack/react-virtual,... not auto install when it as dependences?

#BUG 2

```
Uncaught Error: A React Element from an older version of React was rendered. This is not supported. It can happen if:
- Multiple copies of the "react" package is used.
- A library pre-bundled an old copy of "react" or "react/jsx-runtime".
- A compiler tries to "inline" JSX instead of using the runtime.
```
